# JS8Call

This is, in the flavor of `WSJTX-improved`, an 'improved' version of the original JS8Call, the source
code for which can be found at: https://bitbucket.org/widefido/js8call/src/js8call/

I am not the original author, and have no desire to create a fork, add new features, etc. My motivation
was to have a native version of JS8Call that would run on my Apple Silicon Mac, using a current version
of the Qt and Hamlib libraries. Along the way, I discovered and corrected a few bugs, and made some minor
visual improvements to the UI.

I did stumble over a very significant issue in the way that the underlying WSJTX code performed Fortran
string passing; this bug affects code compiled with GNU Fortran >= 8.0 and a non-GNU C++ compiler, such
as `clang`. This bug exhibits as seemingly random behavior, often things like inexplicable crashes in
azimuth and distance calculation. The fix has been provided to the WSJTX team, and it's present in
WSJTX-improved starting in the test version of August 29th, 2024.

Anyway.....that's what this does; that's all this does. It's not intended to be anything but a vehicle
by which to provide my changes to the original author.

# Notable Changes

- Fixed the aforementioned string passing bug; crashes from this were typically random, but it'd
  usually abort with a segmentation fault in azdist(), sometimes in genjs8().
- The subtractjs8() routine used a common block for large, parameterized arrays. I'd see crashes
  here frequently; it's been a long time since I did any serious development in Fortran, but if
  memory serves, this is a dark corner where in terms of how large that common block is, first
  one in wins, and you hope that it's the larger of the parameterized invocations. If instead,
  the smaller one is dominant, then you'll either trash memory after the common block or crash
  with a segfault. Changed this to use allocations instead of a common block, which seems like
  a solid solution, but again, been a long time since I did this sort of thing in anger.
- Fixed a memory leak present when a custom push to talk command was configured. I haven't gone
  looking for memory leaks with the analysis tools; that one just happened to stand out.
- Fixed a buffer overflow in the code that prints the last transmit.
- Ported to Qt6, which changed the audio classes in a major way. Fortunately the wsjtx-improved
  team had been down this road already, and had dealt with most of the changes needed to the
  audio stuff.
- Incorporated a number of fixes from the upstream WSJTX Fortran library. Key among these was a
  change to how VHF contest mode was handled in some of the common routines; in short, they made
  things a lot simpler, which eliminated the need for passing a lot of dummy parameters just to
  keep them happy.
- Eliminated a large number of unused dummy parameters in the JS8 decoder; warning spam from the
  Fortran compiler was a bit distracting, and hid actual issues, such as uninitialized variables
  in the optimized code.
- Did a bit of work with alignment of data in the tables for better presentation.
- The audio input VU meter looked off to me, as if the scale was on the wrong side; flipped it to
  be next to the level and peak hold, which looks more normal to me. Perhaps just a taste thing;
  easy enough to change it back if necessary. The peak hold indicator was very pixelated on a
  high-DPI display, so it's now antialiased. Fixed the scale to match the VU bar location, and
  addressed the fact that this widget would both update when if was not necessary to do so, would
  fail to update when it was necessary to do so, and would leak its children. All these are also
  present in the original WSJTX code; I need to make them aware, note to self.
- The audio input VU meter was set up such that the 'good' range was 15 dB from the bottom,
  but only 5 dB from the top. I've changed it such that it's 15 dB from both ends, which moves
  the 30 dB tuning spot to a major scale tick.
- The attenuation slider was designed to look like an audio fader control, and it does a
  decent job of this in the `windows` style. However, the underlying `QSlider` control is not
  great in terms of styling consistency; it looks ok but not great in the `fusion` style, and
  quite bizarre in the `macos` style. I've attempted to rectify this via implementation of a
  custom-drawn `QSlider` implementation that consistently looks like a fader on any platform
  style, with the added advantage of always displaying the dB attenuation value.
- Adapted the waterfall scale drawing methodology to accommodate high-DPI displays; fonts
  in the waterfall display should not appear pixelated.
- Hovering on the waterfall display now shows the frequency as a tooltip.
- The waterfall spectrum display has been substantially improved. This does mean that you'll
  have to re-select your preferred spectrum choice on first use, if your choice wasn't the
  default of 'Cumulative'. 'Linear Average' with a smoothing factor of 3 is particularly
  useful; either is in general a more helpful choice than the raw data shown by 'Current'.
- The waterfall display for Cumulative was displaying raw power, uncorrected to dB. Fixed.
- The waterfall display will now intelligently redraw on resize, rather than clearing.
- The 200Hz WSPR portion of the 30m band is now displayed more clearly, i.e., we label it
  as `WSPR`, and the sub-band indicator is located in a manner consistent with that of the
  JS8 sub-band indicators.
- Converted the boost library to an out-of-tree build.
- Updated the sqlite library.
- Updated the CRCpp library.
- Added the Eigen library.
- Updated the Fortran code generation to use 2018 semantics, i.e., `-frecursive`, when dealing
  with large arrays that exceed available stack space, i.e., use allocation, rather than a hidden
  static block, as this tends to be less surprising behavior in modern usage on systems where we
  have memory to burn.
- Fixed an issue where the message server and APRS client should have been moved to the network
  thread, but because they had parent objects, the moves failed. Other than a minor thread
  affinity change required to the APRS client's timer, all the proper setup was already in place
  for the moves, i.e., they were connected to be deleted when the network thread ended, they just
  happened to have parents, and so the moves didn't actually work, resulting in these components
  remaining on the originating thread.
- Ported the updated PSK reporter from the upstream WSJTX code, which allows for use of a TCP
  connection, and implements all of the advances in the upstream code, i.e., more efficient
  spotting to PSK Reporter, omission of redundant spots, and posting of spots is now spread
  more widely in time. As with WSJTX, temporarily, in support of the HamSCI Festivals of Eclipse
  Ionospheric Science, spots will be transmitted more frequently during solar eclipses; see
  https://www.hamsci.org/eclipse for details.
- The DriftingDateTime class was a completely static class, masquerading as a namespace. Since
  any minimum required compiler is now namespace-aware, converted it to a namespace. Added a
  currentSecsSinceEpoch() function to match that of QDateTime.
- Extracted JS8 submode constants and computation functions to a JS8::Submode namespace, for
  clarity; these were previously scattered throughout the MainWindow class, with some duplication
  in the plotter.
- Incorporated revised audio device selection methodology from the upstream WSJTX implementation:
  1. Where possible audio devices that disappear are not forgotten until the user selects
     another device, this should allow temporarily missing devices or forgetting to switch
     on devices before starting JS8Call to be handled more cleanly.
  2. Enumerating  audio devices is expensive and on Linux may take many seconds per device.
     To avoid lengthy blocking behavior until it is absolutely necessary, audio devices are
     not enumerated until one of the "Settings->Audio" device drop-down lists is opened.
     Elsewhere when devices must be discovered the enumeration stops as soon as the configured
     device is  discovered. A status bar message is posted when audio devices are being enumerated
     as a reminder that the UI may block while this is happening.
- Status messages couldn't be displayed in the status bar due to the progress widget taking up
  all available space; for the moment at least, it's restricted to be a defined size.
- Removed an old workaround on OSX for sub-menu display issues that do not seem to be relevant
  to Qt6.
- Removed the UI code backing unused old WSJTX items still present, but hidden, in the UI. Most
  of these were completely dead; those that were still performing work were typically moved to
  instance variables and supporting code.
- Removed the vestiges of the never-used splash screen code. This change evidenced what seems
  to have been race conditions in and inadequate hardening of the MultiSettings class, addressed
  by bringing it forward to the WSJTX-improved version. This same change eliminated manual setup
  of 'quit on last window close' via signals and slots, as Qt has implemented this by default for
  a long time now.
- The UI was hardcoding use of `MS Shell Dlg 2` font  in a few places, principally in the dial
  offset display and the clock. That font is now as one with the dust of history, even on Windows;
  it was taking the startup about 200 milliseconds to figure out suitable replacements, and that’s
  time we can’t get back. Given that it was a sans-serif font very similar to Tahoma or Arial,
  which are the Qt system defaults on just about any platform, I’ve just told it to use the default
  font instead.
- The Check for Updates function now makes use of the `QVersionNumber` class.
- Use of separate 'transmit frequency' and 'receive frequency' concepts in the codebase, a carryover
  from WSJTX, has been eliminated.
- Corrected a display resizing issue in the topmost section; seems to have affected only Linux
  systems, but in theory was broken on any platform.
- Updated the UDP reporting API to be multicast-aware.
- Separated display of distance and azimuth in the Calls table.
- Hovering over an azimuth in the Calls table will now display the closest cardinal compass direction.
- Converted computation of azimuth and distance from Fortran to C++.
- Azimuth and distance calculations will now use the 4th Maidenhead pair, i.e., the Extended field,
  if present.
- The Configuration dialog would allow invalid grid squares to be input; it will now allow only a
  valid square.
- Converted the waterfall `Flatten` function from Fortran to C++. This function now uses the Eigen
  library for polynomial fitting, Chebyshev nodes to avoid Runge's phenomenon, and Estrin's method
  in lieu of Horner's method for polynomial evaluation, which should result in use of SIMD vector
  instructions.
- Converted the FIR filter used for 48kHz -> 12kHz down-sampling by the Detector from Fortran
  to C++, and inlined it into the Detector as a pair of Eigen vectors.
- Removed the undocumented and hidden `Audio/DisableInputResampling=true` configuration option.
- Windows, and only Windows, required a workaround to the Modulator as a result of changes in
  Qt 6.4, which presented as no sound being generated; OSX and Linux worked fine. The issue is
  described in https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-108672, and the workaround seems like a
  grody hack, but it's what WSJTX uses for the same issue, so we're in fine company here.

Qt6 by default will display using a platform-specific style. As a result, there will be some minor
display inconsistencies, e.g., progress bars, as displayed in the bottom of the main window, are
particularly platform-specific.

The earliest version of OSX that Qt6 supports is 11.0. It's set up to compile and link to run
on 11.0 or later, but I've only tested it on 14.6.

Testing on Linux and Windows has been ably provided by Joe Counsil, K0OG, who does the bulk of the
grunt work while I largely just type things and drink coffee.

# Compiling on OSX

 1. Obtain the current version of GNU Fortran, as of this writing 14.2, from https://github.com/fxcoudert/gfortran-for-macOS,
    and install it; you'll end up with an installation in `/usr/local/gfortran`.

 2. Obtain the current version of CMake from https://cmake.org/download/. Both source and binary
    distributions are available; I usually obtain the source distribution and compile, but whatever
    floats your boat is fine.

 3. Create a directory in which to build up the dependencies; the name of this directory doesn't matter,
    but must be used consistently, e.g., `/Users/<username>/Development/js8libs`. Everything we require
    as a dependency will be installed to this path. For purposes of clarity in this document, we'll use:
    ```
    /Users/alb/Development/js8libs
    ```
    Modify as appropriate for your own username and directory structure.

 4. Obtain the current release of libusb, presently version 1.0.27, from https://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb/.
    Unpack the source distribution and install it to the dependencies directory:
    ```
    ./configure --prefix=/Users/alb/Development/js8libs
    make
    make install
    ```

 5. Obtain the current daily snapshot of the Hamlib code from https://n0nb.users.sourceforge.net/; at
    present, this will be some master build of 4.6. Unpack the source distribution and install it to the
    dependencies directory:
    ```
    ./configure --prefix=/Users/alb/Development/js8libs
    make
    make install
    ```

 6. Obtain the current release of fftw, presently version 3.3.10, from https://www.fftw.org/. Unpack the
    source distribution and install it to the dependencies directory:
    ```
    ./configure CFLAGS=-mmacosx-version-min=11.0 \
                --prefix=/Users/alb/Development/js8libs \
                --enable-single \
                --enable-threads
    make
    make install
    ```

 7. Obtain the current release of boost, presently 1.86.0, from https://www.boost.org/. Unpack the source
    distribution and install it to the dependencies directory:
    ```
    ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=/Users/alb/Development/js8libs
    ./b2 -a -q
    ./b2 -a -q install

 8. Obtain and install Qt 6, using the documentation here: https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/macos-building.html.
    When configuring, use the usual `-prefix` option to install the built products into the dependencies
    directory.

 9. Optionally, obtain and install Qt Creator: https://wiki.qt.io/Building_Qt_Creator_from_Git. By
    now, you should be familiar with use of the dependencies directory, so we'll leave that as an
    exercise for the student. You got this. 

    While not strictly necessary, Qt Creator certainly makes debugging relatively simple, so I'd
    go for it, frankly.

10. Create a build directory, typically under this source tree, and run `cmake` to configure the build,
    followed by a `make install`.
    ```
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/Users/alb/Development/js8libs \
          -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    make install
    ```
    There should be a small handful of Fortran warnings; it's practically impossible to get rid of all
    of them; some are false positives, and some just reflect the fact that it's a language with a lot
    of history behind it, and certain things, like using the same array for both in and out intents,
    will tend to upset it, even if that usage is not a problem. If all goes well, you should end up
    with a `js8call` application in the build directory. Test using:
    ```
    open ./js8call.app
    ```
    Once you're satisfied with the test results, copy the `js8call` application to `/Applications`.
