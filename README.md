# JS8Call

This is, in the flavor of `WSJTX-improved`, an 'improved' version of the original JS8Call, the source
code for which can be found at: https://bitbucket.org/widefido/js8call/src/js8call/

I am not the original author, and have no desire to create a fork, add new features, etc. My motivation
was to have a native version of JS8Call that would run on my Apple Silicon Mac, using a current version
of the Qt and Hamlib libraries. Along the way, I discovered and corrected a few bugs, and made some minor
visual improvements to the UI.

Anyway.....that's what this does; that's all this does. It's not intended to be anything but a vehicle
by which to provide my changes to the original author.

# Notable Changes

- Use of Fortran has been eliminated; everything that was previously implemented in Fortran has
  been ported to C++.
- The requirement for a separate decoder process and use of shared memory has been eliminated.
- Ported to Qt6, which changed the audio classes in a major way. Fortunately the wsjtx-improved
  team had been down this road already, and had dealt with most of the changes needed to the
  audio stuff.
- Vestiges of the original WSJTX codebase that were are longer relevant have been removed.
- Did a bit of work with alignment of data in the tables for better presentation.
- Improved the performance and appearance of the audio input VU meter.
- The attenuation slider was designed to look like an audio fader control, and it does a
  decent job of this in the `windows` style. However, the underlying `QSlider` control is not
  great in terms of styling consistency; it looks ok but not great in the `fusion` style, and
  quite bizarre in the `macos` style. I've attempted to rectify this via implementation of a
  custom-drawn `QSlider` implementation that consistently looks like a fader on any platform
  style, with the added advantage of always displaying the dB attenuation value.
- Adapted the waterfall scale drawing methodology to accommodate high-DPI displays.
- Hovering on the waterfall display now shows the frequency as a tooltip.
- The waterfall spectrum display has been substantially improved. This does mean that you'll
  have to re-select your preferred spectrum choice on first use, if your choice wasn't the
  default of 'Cumulative'. 'Linear Average' with a smoothing factor of 3 is particularly
  useful; either is in general a more helpful choice than the raw data shown by 'Current'.
- The waterfall display for Cumulative was displaying raw power, uncorrected to dB. Fixed.
- The waterfall display will now intelligently redraw on resize, rather than clearing.
- The 200Hz WSPR portion of the 30m band is now displayed more clearly, i.e., we label it
  as `WSPR`, and the sub-band indicator is located in a manner consistent with that of the
  JS8 sub-band indicators.
- Converted the boost library to an out-of-tree build.
- Updated the sqlite library.
- Updated the CRCpp library.
- Added the Eigen library.
- Fixed an issue where the message server and APRS client should have been moved to the network
  thread, but because they had parent objects, the moves failed.
- Ported the updated PSK reporter from the upstream WSJTX code, which allows for use of a TCP
  connection, and implements all of the advances in the upstream code, i.e., more efficient
  spotting to PSK Reporter, omission of redundant spots, and posting of spots is now spread
  more widely in time. As with WSJTX, temporarily, in support of the HamSCI Festivals of Eclipse
  Ionospheric Science, spots will be transmitted more frequently during solar eclipses; see
  https://www.hamsci.org/eclipse for details.
- Incorporated revised audio device selection methodology from the upstream WSJTX implementation:
  1. Where possible audio devices that disappear are not forgotten until the user selects
     another device, this should allow temporarily missing devices or forgetting to switch
     on devices before starting JS8Call to be handled more cleanly.
  2. Enumerating  audio devices is expensive and on Linux may take many seconds per device.
     To avoid lengthy blocking behavior until it is absolutely necessary, audio devices are
     not enumerated until one of the "Settings->Audio" device drop-down lists is opened.
     Elsewhere when devices must be discovered the enumeration stops as soon as the configured
     device is  discovered. A status bar message is posted when audio devices are being enumerated
     as a reminder that the UI may block while this is happening.
- Status messages couldn't be displayed in the status bar due to the progress widget taking up
  all available space; for the moment at least, it's restricted to be a defined size.
- Corrected a display resizing issue in the topmost section; seems to have affected only Linux
  systems, but in theory was broken on any platform.
- Updated the UDP reporting API to be multicast-aware.
- Separated display of distance and azimuth in the Calls table.
- Hovering over an azimuth in the Calls table will now display the closest cardinal compass direction.
- Azimuth and distance calculations will now use the 4th Maidenhead pair, i.e., the Extended field,
  if present.
- The Configuration dialog would allow invalid grid squares to be input; it will now allow only a
  valid square.
- Removed the undocumented and hidden `Audio/DisableInputResampling=true` configuration option.
- Windows, and only Windows, required a workaround to the Modulator as a result of changes in
  Qt 6.4, which presented as no sound being generated; OSX and Linux worked fine. The issue is
  described in https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-108672, and the workaround seems like a
  grody hack, but it's what WSJTX uses for the same issue, so we're in fine company here.

Qt6 by default will display using a platform-specific style. As a result, there will be some minor
display inconsistencies, e.g., progress bars, as displayed in the bottom of the main window, are
particularly platform-specific.

The earliest version of OSX that Qt6 supports is 11.0. It's set up to compile and link to run
on 11.0 or later, but I've only tested it on 14.6, 14.7, and 15.3.

Testing on Linux and Windows has been ably provided by Joe Counsil, K0OG, who does the bulk of the
grunt work while I largely just type things and drink coffee.

# Compiling on OSX

 1. Obtain the current version of CMake from https://cmake.org/download/. Both source and binary
    distributions are available; I usually obtain the source distribution and compile, but whatever
    floats your boat is fine.

 2. Create a directory in which to build up the dependencies; the name of this directory doesn't matter,
    but must be used consistently, e.g., `/Users/<username>/Development/js8libs`. Everything we require
    as a dependency will be installed to this path. For purposes of clarity in this document, we'll use:
    ```
    /Users/alb/Development/js8libs
    ```
    Modify as appropriate for your own username and directory structure.

 3. Obtain the current release of libusb, presently version 1.0.27, from https://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb/.
    Unpack the source distribution and install it to the dependencies directory:
    ```
    ./configure --prefix=/Users/alb/Development/js8libs
    make
    make install
    ```

 4. Obtain the current daily snapshot of the Hamlib code from https://n0nb.users.sourceforge.net/; at
    present, this will be 4.6.1 . Unpack the source distribution and install it to the dependencies
    directory:
    ```
    ./configure --prefix=/Users/alb/Development/js8libs
    make
    make install
    ```

 5. Obtain the current release of fftw, presently version 3.3.10, from https://www.fftw.org/. Unpack the
    source distribution and install it to the dependencies directory:
    ```
    ./configure CFLAGS=-mmacosx-version-min=11.0 \
                --prefix=/Users/alb/Development/js8libs \
                --enable-single \
                --enable-threads
    make
    make install
    ```
    Depending on the architecture in use, a non-trivial speedup can be performed by enabling
    SIMD instructions. For example, to do so on ARM architecture Macs, add `--enable-neon`.

    See https://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc/Installation-on-Unix.html for further details on other architectures.

 6. Obtain the current release of boost, presently 1.86.0, from https://www.boost.org/. Unpack the source
    distribution and install it to the dependencies directory:
    ```
    ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=/Users/alb/Development/js8libs
    ./b2 -a -q
    ./b2 -a -q install

 7. Obtain and install Qt 6, using the documentation here: https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/macos-building.html.
    When configuring, use the usual `-prefix` option to install the built products into the dependencies
    directory.

 8. Optionally, obtain and install Qt Creator: https://wiki.qt.io/Building_Qt_Creator_from_Git. By
    now, you should be familiar with use of the dependencies directory, so we'll leave that as an
    exercise for the student. You got this. 

    While not strictly necessary, Qt Creator certainly makes debugging relatively simple, so I'd
    go for it, frankly.

 9. Create a build directory, typically under this source tree, and run `cmake` to configure the build,
    followed by a `make install`.
    ```
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/Users/alb/Development/js8libs \
          -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    make install
    ```
    If all goes well, you should end up with a `js8call` application in the build directory. Test using:
    ```
    open ./js8call.app
    ```
    Once you're satisfied with the test results, copy the `js8call` application to `/Applications`.
